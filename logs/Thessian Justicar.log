[2024-01-08 05:26:51.700951] Thessian Justicar: /me "Would it matter?... Wouldn't it spoil the fun if I were to answer?" the stranger asks, letting out a quiet chuckle to herself at his question. Shuffling is heard, as the mysterious stranger is repositioning themselves in preparation for their guest. "I'm going to assume that you certainly are one... Though, I reckon I will find out shortly."
