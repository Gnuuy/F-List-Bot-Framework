[2024-01-19 04:11:42.645171] Doctor Valais: !set_description A feline, furry occupant covered in perfectly smooth, form-fitting, silver latex from head to toe is patiently kneeling inside, eyes obscured by an opaque pink visor. The only opening in their bodysuit is for their mouth and a small bit around their nose. The material is tight enough to make it clear there's nothing underneath. Displayed across the visor for observers is the text, "Obedience Program Enabled." Perhaps she's actually a very realistic robot or fembot of some kind?

Over the single hole for the booth is a little screen displaying, "Servicing male and female clients only at this time."
[2024-01-19 06:50:16.565747] Doctor Valais: /me raises up from where she'd been patiently kneeling for some time to scoot forward as someone approaches. Without a word, the silver latex-clad occupant opens her mouth expectantly, calmly, the text on her visor that reads "Obedience Program Enabled" disappearing from view as a warm mouth and wet tongue are presented instead. For all the possibility that the booth was actually occupied by a robot of some sort, it sure seems quite authentically organic.
[2024-01-19 06:55:04.129430] Doctor Valais: !set_description Currently occupied, there are occasional glimpses of the participant wearing a silver latex bodysuit that covers everything except their mouth and a small bit around their nose. Flickers of an opaque pink visor covering their eyes come into view from time to time, but most of the occupant is obscured from view with her mouth readily pushed forward to service her client. The shape of her muzzle suggests it's a furry occupant of some sort, but the shiny metallic surface of the latex and the visor hint that perhaps it's actually a robot of some sort.
[2024-01-19 07:00:32.793394] Doctor Valais: /me calmly reaches up and wraps a shimmery, metallic-hued, latex-wrapped hand around his tip as it's pushed into the hole, gently stroking with her smooth fingers. She tips her jaw down, then scoops him up into her mouth and lets him rest on her tongue. Her muzzle gingerly closes around him and her tongue begins to rub back and forth in small motions. The movements are calm, practiced, almost mechanical. If she's breathing, it's quiet and barely noticeable. She hardly makes a sound as she obediently tends to the offered cock - unfortunately semi-flaccid, clearly needing to be worked into a better position. Her other hand draws up to palm his balls, just gently cupping for the moment.
[2024-01-19 07:12:40.327371] Doctor Valais: /me keeps her head-bobbing shallow for the moment. Steady, rhythmic, never skipping a beat or shifting in pace. By only tending to his glans, her tongue is free to swirl and rub and cup, to truly lavish attention at his tip. Still, as he pulses and throbs, his blood rushing from his head where it certainly wouldn't be needed for what he was up to, she starts to bob a little deeper, offering more of her tongue for him to lie in and be wrapped in that warm, wet embrace. With more shaft to stroke, her fingers start to glide back and forth in longer strokes, a somewhat loose grip that allows her to slowly twist with each motion down and up. She gently - ever so gently - begins to fondle his balls, gently rubbing her palm against them, then closing her fingers around them without squeezing, just letting her gloved hands caress and entice.
[2024-01-19 07:35:03.113952] Doctor Valais: /me seems honed in on every little twitch, every throb, every breath and groan and sound he makes - whether he realizes he's doing it in his intoxicated state or not, the occupant is clearly paying sharp attention to him. She makes small adjustments, squeezing just a little on this downstroke, suckling just a little longer on that head-bob, pushing just a little deeper and pausing her tonguing to instead let her cheeks puff out as he's stuffed into her mouth. If she's getting worked up, herself, there's no indication - breathing still so subtle that it's still not entirely clear whether she's actually needing to or not. As he stands fully erect, she shifts up on her knees a little, then lowers the tip of her latex-clad nose as far down as she can go. Her throat relaxes, her cheeks fill out, and his tip presses in as far as it will go. Her tongue is pushed flat against the bottom of her mouth, a bit of drool running down his shaft as her ability to swallow is cut off. Perhaps a point in favor if it being someone just dressed in a tight bodysuit and not a fembot after all? And yet she's so diligent, so rhythmic as she draws back and begins to bob back and forth, not vigorous or enthused, but obedient and compliant. All the while she's stroking and caressing along his balls and the base of his shaft, just utterly fixated on what he's presented to be serviced.
[2024-01-19 07:53:51.620500] Doctor Valais: /me makes no motion of gagging or suggesting that she was trying to overcome such a reflex. She doesn't gasp for air. She doesn't struggle or shiver or tremble. She just sucks. She just strokes. She just fondles. She just obeys the implicit command of the impressive cock and balls that had been presented to her, as if her sole purpose was to drain them into her with as hard an orgasm she could elicit from the bull - if she wasn't operating on actual programming, then she must've been in an even deeper hypnotic trance than she was putting the bull into. But none of that mattered in that moment - all that mattered was a throbbing, pulsing, straining cock that would certainly need to release before it pulled so much blood out of his head that he'd pass out. And the attentions the occupant of the booth shift to that end - where her slight adjustments and motions might've been to entice him, to pleasure him, there was a shift towards tending to his sensitive tip, less impressing by deepthroating, more practiced attention from her tongue, rubbing and licking in all the right places, before bobbing back and forth with an increased, rhythmic, but still mechanical pace, her silvery, smooth hands pumping away along his shaft.
[2024-01-19 08:12:22.042223] Doctor Valais: /me wordlessly obeys the command, her decision-making quickly replaced by his demand. She lowers herself as far as she can while still being able to hollow her cheeks out and draw her tongue up against his cock to suck, still giving a bit of a bobbing motion so that the back of her tongue would rub against the bottom of his tip, her fingers working up and down the exposed base of his shaft. He had told her to suck harder and that is exactly what she did without a moment's hesitation - either eager to please, eager for him to cum, or both. If she wasn't a suck-toy set on a "drain" setting, she was certainly playing the part well.
(May have to disappear rather shortly.)
[2024-01-19 08:30:20.123680] Doctor Valais: /me swallows as much as she can before the inevitable spillage begins to happen, at which point she simply eases off him and presses her mouth up against his tip, tongue continuing to undulate and swallow while he otherwise makes a mess of her face, his cum sliding along her silvery, slippery latex. As his orgasm fades, then just as wordlessly as the experience began, she settles back. The text on her visor that had originally read "Obedience Program Enabled" fades and is replaced with "Cleaning In Progress", before the booth is rather unceremoniously emptied.
