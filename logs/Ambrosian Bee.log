[2023-12-21 01:57:10.869874] Ambrosian Bee: /me shuffles and movement could be heard behind the relatively thin wall, the hole centered waist height covered with a simple thin curtain of cloth being rustled as a low humming noise can be heard followed up by the soft 'thwump' of clothes being dropped to the ground along with the slightest of huffs. Silence falling in the small room on the other side before ultimately the silence would be broken by the slightest of movements as the curtain would be swished aside by an ominous slab of blackened meat, bobbing and twitching as the length was coaxed through the small opening and left to sway slightly in the air.

On the other side of the wall, more movement could be heard as the room occupant seemed to be getting themselves adjusted and comfortable with their pelvis gently pressed up against the cool surface of the dividing wall, multiple digits being heard sliding across cool surfaces as if trying to figure out what just to do with their hands before ultimately going silent once more. A low humming noise still accompanying as the divider wall was all that laid between either side, the soft sweet scent of [color=pink]something[/color] being detected as it gently wafted off the slowly stiffening slab of dick before the smallest bead of glistening [color=orange]pre[/color] would bubble and bloom before tumbling down to the floor with a soft yet wet [color=orange]splat[/color] followed by the slightest of humming sighs on the opposite side of the wall.
