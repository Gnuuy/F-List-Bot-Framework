[2024-01-08 23:02:16.381204] Little Piano Lady: !set_description As you approach the booth, you hear a quiet sonata being elegantly performed via piano.  The various improv fills performed give you the impression that such music is being performed in the present time, perhaps on an electric keyboard, as the sound escapes the hole.  Upon listening a bit more closely, a feminine soprano humming could be heard, coming from the lips just barely visible from the hole, clad in red lipstick as they mouthed off a harmony to join the melody and bassline that the piano had crafted.  

The sign itself below the reads, in a cursive script, "A Song of Suck;  A Piece to be Composed by you and I."

[2024-01-09 21:54:32.245244] Little Piano Lady: !set_description [i]As you approach the mysterious hole in the wall, the soft, gentle caress of music graces your ears.  A somewhat compressed rendition of a piano playing from an electronic keyboard formed into a beautiful melody, with a rolling bassline quietly under the otherwise still air of the stalls.  Upon closer hearing, the pair of lips hiding behind that hole pushed out a series of hums, tying the melody and bassline together with a bright, moving harmony.  Drawing closer, you can hear fingers pushing down into against the plastic keys, soft thuds clunking against the membrane on the boards.  This was a live performance, for sure...  

Having drawn closer, you can finally parse the cursive sign posted right above the sign.  Elegant letters scribed beautifully in golden ink, a bevy of sparkles reflecting off the sign to get your attention.  It reads as follows:[/i]

"A Song of Suck:  A Performance by Yourself and I.
Live Performance and Fellatio."
[2024-01-09 23:34:02.270876] Little Piano Lady: The sounds of music continued to play through the hole in the wall, the subtle thumps of plastic keys on membrane pressing into circuitry waning as the volume of the song seemed to decrescendo.  As this stranger pushed their cock in the wall, a curious, soprano hum rang through the wall, the barely visible lips parting as the voice offered a giggle.  A Gm7 chord spread across a low range octave and mid-high range one rang through the wall, gently vibrating the wall itself as the voice called out a g5 “ah” before swiftly being muffled.  The other participant could feel the warm cavern of this hidden pianist’s mouth, unmistakably so, as their tongue came up and gently flicked the tip of that cock.  Their lips would push forward, dragging that tongue along as they slowly stuffed more of that cock inside.  As they did this, a low register Gm7 was played while a slow arpeggio of the chord was played on the high end of the keyboard.  

It then shifted into a song, played in the Gm key, a slow steady trail of arpeggiated notes jumping from chord to chord as the tip of that dick kissed the back of her throat.  At a tempo of roughly 70 bpm, those lips would time the song on half notes, pushing forward and pulling back as the higher register continued to arpeggiate in eights.  On occasion, a diad would be slipped into the arpeggio, and the pianist would squeeze her lips around the shaft to emphasize it.

[2024-01-10 00:04:28.356126] Little Piano Lady: /me | The person hidden behind this hole could tell that the participant was getting rather immersed in the song, hips naturally moving back and forth in tempo with their tune.  It was maintained for a little bit, giving the dick-owner some level of comfort as the piano kept up its performance.  However, everything came to a stop on a Dm9, a held fermata represented by those soft, plush lips hooking themselves into the back of the glans for several seconds.  For a moment, silence, as the piano died out and the lips pulled away, only for a few trickles of minor triads to quietly sink out of the hole, accompanied by the erratic licking of the pianist's tongue against that spongy tip.  Time signatures be damned, it seemed that each note and each lick was just another way of keeping that poor participant guessing.  

A key change to Em came out of nowhere, and the tempo bumped up to 130ish bpm, and the cock was once again taken between those warm lips, wet, drooling maw closing in on it and thrusting up and down that length, not only at this tempo, but with a switch to quarter notes from the original half notes that were chosen.  The speed at which those lips bobbed up and down that schaft gave nice, wet, percussive slicks to keep the time of the song as it spiraled into a dangerous, fast piece.  
[2024-01-10 00:28:30.255538] Little Piano Lady: /me | The pianist would let small, pleased hums escape their lips as they bounced their jaw up and down their target's shaft.  Tongue lashing wildly against it as her piano piece gradually began to [i]accelerando[/i], the loud, wet schlicks slurping their way from the pianist's jaw following the tempo.  Perhaps the pianist found it amusing that the recipient of this live, interactive performance was struggling to follow along, and just to make things even worse for them, the pianist would hold chords on a fermata, lips resting for a couple of seconds either snug around the tip, or just before the hole in the wall.  

Oh, the number of close calls pianist offered, too, the frequent tease of her throat as the two of them played their little duet.  By now, the pianist had climbed to about 165 bpm, a heavy crescendo bringing a loud burst of music over time.  With a booming fortissississimo, loud thuds audible from the keyboard as fingers slammed down into it to play the rapid, intricate parts.  High register and low register would swap from full  chords and arpeggios between one another, all while their head made exaggerated movements, squeezing that member tight with their lips as they continued to tease the back of that throat.  
[2024-01-10 01:09:27.731697] Little Piano Lady: /me | The pianist continued their song, getting louder and louder as their victim throbbed harder and harder.  Each twitch, each spasm of that length signaling that they were just a little bit closer to bursting their load.  Sloppy, rapid motions of the pianist's head pushing and pulling hard as their tongue swirled around that shaft, doing its best to coax the participant to a swift and seedy end.  

The piece itself had gone pretty much off the rails, both hands trailing into two series of arpeggios that worked together to detail one complex chord, then another, then another.  This was no doubt the prelude to the climax of the piece, completely with a drop to pianossississimo before steadily rolling back to maximum dynamics fighting to get the participant to cum.  At this point, they'd even start feeling a bit of that coveted throat, tight, hot, wet, and squeezing that cock each time it pushed in.  
[2024-01-10 01:36:11.593743] Little Piano Lady: /me | The pianist reached the climax of the song, a series of chords rapidly descending in pitch as this participant reached the end of their rope.  Before long, the pianist was rewarded with that which they sought, a series of ropes of cum to coat their tongue, their throat, and hopefully [b]not[/b] their keyboard.  Loudly gulping on it as the tempo of the song rapidly slow to a crawl.  Their tongue would then glide along the shaft, soft huffs coming from the back of the throat as they cleaned that cock up.  The pianist then concluded the piece with a Dadd9 chord, letting the soft dissonance of the E-natural ring around the rest of the chord as their plush lips planted a single, conclusive kiss to the tip of that cock.  

They cleared their throat, the plastic flick of a switch cutting a quiet layer of feedback that most likely went unnoticed until it was no longer there.  Gentle applause was offered as the sounds of the pianist standing up could be heard from the wall, a brief glimpse of a skirt being visible through the hole.

[2024-01-10 21:32:21.491208] Little Piano Lady: !set_description [i]A soft piano melody rests beneath the air as you draw closer to the mysterious, lustful hole in the wall.  The air somewhat dry, thanks to the biting chill of a mid winter day, the various notes are able to pass you buy and stand your hairs on end.  Unmistakable technique, it almost seems like it's a prerecorded melody, especially with the even more gentle hum of feedback resting just below the melodies and chords.  Mixed in with the various other sounds is a series of hums, forming a harmony that ties the chords and the melodic line together.  

With eyes on the dimly lit sign, one could parse out the glittery cursive writing.  Gold ink with silver sequins shimmering just above that lewd little hole, spelling reading out:[/i]

"A Song of Suck:  A Duet Between You and I.
Fellatio and Live Performance.  Tips appreciated."

[2024-01-12 20:04:23.414873] Little Piano Lady: !set_description [i]As you approach the various stalls, the very first one you come across ends up doing a rather good job of catching your attention.  A soft piano melody flowed through the hole in the wall, the gentle, subtle hum of audio feedback droning along that would be an unmistakable sign of a cheap electronic keyboard.  Mixed in with the heavy bass chords and the flowing melodic line was the gentle, feminine humming of a harmonic line, tying the piece together and bringing balance to it.  

Having moved closer, curious as to its sounds, you can see the plush lips of someone, likely a woman, on the otherside of that hole, painted a subtle red with a glossy sheen.  They were gently parted, letting out air for that sweet, angelic humming that had gently caressed your ears.  Unfortunately, do to the nature of the hole, that was the only hint, the only thing you could see on this mysterious person.  

Above the hole, written in a somewhat messy cursive, in golden letters and covered with silvered sparkles.  Though you couldn't read the admittedly sloppy handiwork when you first entered, it was much more clear now that you were only just a couple of feet away.

[2024-01-13 00:07:47.275668] Little Piano Lady: /me | The pianist at the other side of the hole was, at the moment, rather invested in the melody that they had accidentally stumbled upon, and as the pale, sagging shaft pushed through the hole and pushed against their lips,  the pianist gave a brief high pitched squeal.  The gentle scratching of hair and scalp could be heard, and soon enough, the pianist's right hand gripped the shaft, offering a few gentle strokes as their lips peppered the head, painting it a soft crimson with their lipstick.  The left hand played some simple chord progressions, following the key of Gm and taking a rather slow tempo as the right hand and their lips worked to get this stranger hard.
